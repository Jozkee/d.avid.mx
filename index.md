## Hi

My name's David, I use the pseudonyms jozky/jozkyy/jozkee (the last two when the first one is not available). I'm a software engineer based in Austin but I was born and raised in Nuevo León, México.

For the last {{ "now" | date: "%s" | minus: "1559365200" | date: "%Y" | minus: "1970" }} years I've been working for Microsoft as a member of the .NET libraries team working on open-source project [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) where I've owned areas like `System.Diagnostics.Process`, `System.IO`, `System.Security`, and `System.Text.Json`, to name a few. My current role grants me opportunities to learn about cross-platform development, file systems, IPC, interoperability, benchmarking, and many low-level things.
